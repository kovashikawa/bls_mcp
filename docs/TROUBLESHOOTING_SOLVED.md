# 🎉 **PROBLEM SOLVED!** 

## ✅ **Issue Identified & Fixed**

The problem was that you had **conflicting ngrok processes** running. Here's what happened:

1. **Existing ngrok process** (PID: 82839) was tunneling port 80
2. **New ngrok process** tried to create a tunnel but failed due to conflict
3. **Error**: `"The endpoint 'https://uncriticisable-multilaterally-semaj.ngrok-free.dev' is already online"`

## 🔧 **Solution Applied**

1. ✅ **Killed conflicting process**: `kill 82839`
2. ✅ **Fixed SSE transport syntax error** in `transports/sse.py`
3. ✅ **Added cleanup logic** to ngrok script
4. ✅ **Created startup script** for easy launching

## 🚀 **How to Start Your Server Now**

### **Option 1: Quick Start (Recommended)**
```bash
cd /Users/rafaelkovashikawa/Downloads/projects/bls_food/bls_mcp
./start_public_server.sh
```

### **Option 2: Manual Start**
```bash
cd /Users/rafaelkovashikawa/Downloads/projects/bls_food/bls_mcp
uv run python scripts/start_ngrok.py
```

### **Option 3: Local Only (stdio)**
```bash
cd /Users/rafaelkovashikawa/Downloads/projects/bls_food/bls_mcp
uv run python scripts/start_server.py
```

## 🌐 **What You'll Get**

When you start the server, you'll see:
```
🚀 Starting BLS MCP Server with ngrok tunnel
🌐 Creating ngrok tunnel for port 3000
✅ ngrok tunnel created: https://your-url.ngrok.io
📡 Local server: http://localhost:3000
```

## 🧪 **Test Your Server**

Once running, test these endpoints:
- **Health Check**: `https://your-url.ngrok.io/health`
- **SSE Stream**: `https://your-url.ngrok.io/sse`
- **MCP API**: `https://your-url.ngrok.io/mcp`

## 📋 **Available Tools**

Your server provides these BLS data tools:
- `get_series` - Fetch BLS data series by ID
- `list_series` - List all available series
- `get_series_info` - Get detailed series metadata

## 🎯 **Ready to Go!**

Your MCP server is now fully functional and ready for:
- ✅ **Local testing** (stdio transport)
- ✅ **Remote access** (ngrok + SSE transport)
- ✅ **Claude Desktop integration**
- ✅ **Public API access**

**Just run `./start_public_server.sh` and you're live!** 🚀
