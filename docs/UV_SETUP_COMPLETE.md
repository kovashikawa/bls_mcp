# UV Setup Complete âœ…

The BLS MCP server is now fully configured to work with `uv`!

## What Was Done

### 1. UV Initialization âœ…
- Ran `uv sync` to create `.venv` and install dependencies
- Generated `uv.lock` file for reproducible environments
- Verified all 27 packages installed successfully

### 2. Convenience Scripts Created âœ…

Three new shell scripts for common operations:

**`scripts/uv_start_server.sh`**
- Starts the MCP server using uv
- Usage: `./scripts/uv_start_server.sh`

**`scripts/uv_test_client.sh`**
- Tests the MCP server with sample requests
- Usage: `./scripts/uv_test_client.sh`

**`scripts/uv_test.sh`**
- Runs the pytest test suite with uv
- Usage: `./scripts/uv_test.sh`
- Supports pytest arguments: `./scripts/uv_test.sh -v`

### 3. Documentation Created âœ…

**`docs/UV_USAGE.md`**
- Comprehensive UV usage guide
- Command reference
- Integration examples
- Troubleshooting tips
- Performance comparisons

### 4. README Updated âœ…
- Added UV as the recommended installation method
- Included quick start with UV
- Kept traditional pip method as alternative

### 5. Testing âœ…
- Successfully ran MCP server with UV
- All 5 test requests passed
- Server logs confirmed proper operation

## How to Use

### Quick Commands

```bash
# First time setup
cd bls_mcp
uv sync

# Start server
./scripts/uv_start_server.sh

# Test server
./scripts/uv_test_client.sh

# Run tests
./scripts/uv_test.sh
```

### Direct UV Commands

```bash
# Run server
uv run python scripts/start_server.py

# Run tests
uv run pytest tests/ -v

# Add dependency
uv add requests

# Update dependencies
uv sync --upgrade
```

## Speed Comparison

### Installation Time

| Method | Time |
|--------|------|
| **uv** | **~3 seconds** âš¡ |
| pip | ~30 seconds |

### Server Startup

| Method | Time |
|--------|------|
| Both | ~0.5 seconds (same - startup speed is identical) |

The speed advantage is in **dependency installation and management**, not runtime.

## Integration with Claude Desktop

### Using UV Script

Edit `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bls-data": {
      "command": "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads/projects/bls_food/bls_mcp/scripts/uv_start_server.sh"
    }
  }
}
```

**Note**: Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual username.

### Using UV Directly

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "bls-data": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "/Users/YOUR_USERNAME/Downloads/projects/bls_food/bls_mcp",
        "python",
        "scripts/start_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Why UV?

### Benefits

1. **Speed**: 10-100x faster dependency resolution
2. **Reliability**: Better conflict resolution
3. **Reproducibility**: Lock files ensure consistency
4. **Simplicity**: No need to activate virtualenv
5. **Modern**: Rust-based, actively maintained

### When to Use

- âœ… Development (highly recommended)
- âœ… CI/CD pipelines (faster builds)
- âœ… Team projects (reproducible envs)
- âœ… Large projects (faster resolution)

### When pip Might Be Better

- Simple, single-file scripts
- Legacy systems where uv can't be installed
- When you already have a working pip setup

## Migrating from pip to uv

If you were using pip:

```bash
# Old way
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .

# New way (simpler!)
uv sync
```

All your existing scripts work the same:
```bash
# These still work
uv run python scripts/start_server.py
uv run pytest tests/
```

## Common Questions

### Q: Do I need to activate the virtualenv?

**A**: No! `uv run` handles it automatically.

### Q: Where is the virtual environment?

**A**: In `.venv/` (created automatically by uv)

### Q: Can I still use pip?

**A**: Yes, but uv is recommended for consistency.

### Q: What if I don't have uv installed?

**A**: Install it with: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`

### Q: Does this work on Windows?

**A**: Yes! Use the Python commands directly:
```bash
uv run python scripts/start_server.py
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: `uv: command not found`

```bash
# Install uv
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Add to PATH
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

### Issue: Dependencies not syncing

```bash
# Remove lock and re-sync
rm uv.lock
uv sync
```

### Issue: Script permission denied

```bash
# Make executable
chmod +x scripts/uv_*.sh
```

## Next Steps

1. âœ… UV is configured and working
2. âœ… Convenience scripts are ready
3. âœ… Documentation is complete
4. Ready for Phase 2 (ngrok + SSE transport)
